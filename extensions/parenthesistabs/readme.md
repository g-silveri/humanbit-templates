# Parenthesis Tabs

This Symphony extension looks for fields in the publish area that contain text in parentheses in their label. It creates tabs based on the matches and hides all fields that don't belong to the selected tab but keeps those fields without parentheses. Along with Jens Scherbl's [Multilingual extension](https://github.com/jensscherbl/multilingual) this allows the creation of a custom backend layout where you only see one language at a time but always have access to universal fields that don't change based on languages.
